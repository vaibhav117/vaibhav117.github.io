      institution: CILVR Lab, New York University, New York City, US
      year: June 2021 - Present
      description:
        - Exploring Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Self Supervised Learning (SSL) methods for Robot Learning under Prof. Lerrel Pinto
        - Developed a novel Inverse RL method called Regularised Optimal Transport that adaptively combines an Imitation Learning prior with RL exploration capable of learning many robotics tasks using a single expert demo with a 7.8x speedup to reach a 90% success rate over existing baselines.
        - Created a framework for Vision based learning using RL, sim2real and Domain Randomisation methods to adapt a policy trained in Simulation to the real world to complete tasks such as Pick and Place and PegInsertion.

    - title: Software Development Engineer
      institution: Zomato, Gurgaon, India
      year: Feb 2019 - Nov 2020
      description:
        - Built Zomato’s in-house Distributed and Highly Scalable Monitoring and Alerting Platform. The platform reduced incident response time by 80% and allowed for Preemptive Incident Detection and Alerting.
        - Created the Dynamic Inter-service Discovery and Communication for microservices using Envoy and a Golang microservice for AWS ECS Container discovery enabling migration to a microservice-based architecture.
        - Set up Zomato’s Distributed Relational Database. It distributed query load and reduced query failure rates by 87%.

      institution: Hong Kong Shanghai Bank (HSBC), Pune, India
      year: Sept 2013 - Feb 2019
      description:
        - Led team’s service migration to HSBC’s Internal Cloud Platform.
        - Created the Microservice Deployment Service acting as an internal CICD tool in Spring Boot. Reduced service deployment incidents by 53% and decreased the service deployment time to <1 min.

      description:
        - Transfering an RL policy learnt in simulation to a real Xarm7 robot.
        - Used Asymmetric Actor Critic model to learn the policy in Mujoco simulation.
        - Used Domain Randomisation as means for Domain Adaptation to the real world.
        - Used Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) to allow more efficient learning in a Sparse Reward setting.
