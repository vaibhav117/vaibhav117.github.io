Iâ€™m a technologist working at the intersection of Research and Systems. I am currently persuing my masters from <a href='https://engineering.nyu.edu/'> New York University </a>. I love solving tough problems with little to no support which requires me to understand every aspect of the solution thoroughly.

During my masters program, I mostly worked at the <a href='https://www.lerrelpinto.com/group/'> Generalizable Robotics and AI Lab </a> advised by <a href='https://www.lerrelpinto.com/'> Prof. Lerrel Pinto </a> on Robot Learning techniques.

Prior to my masters program, I worked at <a href='https://www.zomato.com/india'> Zomato </a> where I built scalable Distributed Systems for production services and essential components.
